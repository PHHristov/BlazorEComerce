Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill within you the values ​​of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer—but only if you work at it. What kind of work will you be doing? You'll be reading code—lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what's right about that code, and what's wrong with it. more importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values ​​and your commitment to your craft. Clean code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code.",
